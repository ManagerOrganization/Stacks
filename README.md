#Stacks

Have you ever wondered how Feedly's app manages to make its feed look like a stack of cards? We have, and Stacks is what we came up with.

Stacks is a preview-able card view. As you're scrolling through, you are able to see a preview of the next or previous card.

##Assumptions 
(If you run into any problems, first check the following list)
This project assumes the following:
- You are using a UICollectionView.
- The UICollectionViewCell takes up the whole screen.
- UICollectionView's scrolling is disabled.

##How
- Drag and drop the 'Stacks' folder into your project
- In the UIViewController that houses the UICollectionView, #import "StacksViewController.h" and change the base class from 'UIViewController' to 'StacksViewController'
- Point your array and collectionview to self.arrayStacks and self.collectionViewStacks = _collectionView respectively.
- Voila, you're all set.


##Extras 
arrayOffset: If you are showing items in addition to the ones in the array, use this integer.
NSInteger currentPage: If you want to find out which index/page the collectionView is on, use this integer.
BOOL swipeable: If you want to disable swiping all together, use this boolean.
